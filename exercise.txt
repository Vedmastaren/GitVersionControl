Group Exercise 1
      Basic Git Collaboration


Objective:
To gain practical experience in using basic Git commands and workflows by collaboratively working on a simple project.
Resources Needed:
    • Computers with Git installed.
    • Internet connection for accessing a shared remote repository (e.g., GitHub).

Instructions:
Step 1: Group Setup
    • 3-4 students per group
    • One member of your group creates a new repository on GitHub and adds others as collaborators.
Step 2: Clone and Initialize
    • Your group clones the repository to their local machines using git clone.
    • Initialize the project by adding a simple README.md file. Commit the file to the master branch.
Step 3: Simple Branching and Changes 
    • Each member of your group creates their own branch using git checkout -b [branch-name].
    • Each member of your group makes a simple addition to the README.md, such as adding their name and a brief description of their role.
Step 4: Commit and Push
    • Your group members commit their changes to their branches with git add and git commit.
    • Push your branches to the remote repository using git push origin [branch-name].
Step 5: Pull Requests and Merging
    • Each member of your group creates a pull request on GitHub to merge their branch into the master.
    • Your group reviews and merges each pull request, discussing any changes briefly.
Step 6: Final Pull and Review
    • Everyone pulls the final version of the README.md from the master branch to their local machine using git pull.
    • Quick group discussion on the workflow, what you learned about Git, and how you can apply these practices to future projects.		
Hand-in:
    • A README.md file that includes contributions from all members.
    • A brief discussion or write-up on the process and learnings.
